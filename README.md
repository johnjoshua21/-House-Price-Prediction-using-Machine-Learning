*🏡 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning*

*📌 Project Overview*

This project uses Linear Regression to predict house prices based on key features such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, and location. The model is trained on historical housing data and provides estimated prices for new inputs.

*🛠️ Technologies Used*


Python

Pandas & NumPy (Data Preprocessing)

Scikit-learn (Linear Regression Model)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)

Jupyter Notebook


*📊 Dataset Description*


The dataset contains the following features:

Feature	Description

date:	Date of the sale

price:	Sale price of the house (Target Variable)

bedrooms:	Number of bedrooms in the house

bathrooms:	Number of bathrooms in the house

sqft_living:	Total square footage of living space

sqft_lot:	Total square footage of the lot

floors:	Number of floors in the house

waterfront:	Whether the house is near a waterfront (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

view:	Quality of the view from the house

condition:	Overall condition of the house (rating)

sqft_above:	Square footage of the above-ground living space

sqft_basement:	Square footage of the basement

yr_built:	Year the house was built

yr_renovated:	Year the house was last renovated

street:	Street name where the house is located

city:	City where the house is located

statezip:	State and ZIP code of the property

country:	Country where the property is located


*🚀 Machine Learning Workflow*

Data Preprocessing – Handling missing values, feature encoding, and scaling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Identifying trends, correlations, and data distributions.
Feature Engineering – Selecting relevant features for better prediction accuracy.
*Model Training – Using Linear Regression*
Prediction – Estimating house prices for new data:
Model Evaluation – Checking model accuracy using RMSE and R² Score.
